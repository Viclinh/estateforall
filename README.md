Inspiration
The purpose of life for many people is to have a stable life. In order to achieve that, owning a house is the first step for a stable life and can make a huge difference for people's financial future. Homeownership can help to build people's financial wealth and get out of poverty due to home equity, which will likely increase over time. However, home ownership keeps decreasing currently for young people. According to U.S Census and American Community survey, the home ownership rates dropped sharply among households headed by young adults from 1960 to 2017. The cause for the decrease was because of rising house prices. Because of that many young and low income people cannot afford to buy homes. With the thought of resolving housing issue and help people, especially young and low income people, set up basic stone of their lives, which is owing a house and build their equities, we want to introduce Estate for all. Our aim is to help everyone have ability to invest in real estate and gradually build their equities. People do not have to pay a big sum of money for a house. Instead they can have fractional ownership of a house through purchasing tokens.

What it does
In order to find the house they want, users can type the location, choose category of real estate, choose the size of the lot and price range. Users can check out the list of houses we have on our website. The number of tokens left for the house is stated clearly and the percent indicates how much tokens are left to own the house. Each house has description that shows number of bathrooms and bedrooms and a description about the house. People can make transaction by clicking the "make transaction" button and they can check their wallet and transfer funds. We also have a chatbot that teaches people about crypto and help people check their account balance or wallet. Also, with the rise of Metaverse, we offer NFT real estate. Click the NFT Properties button and see the NFT properties. Users can get help from our customer service representative by sending text message to the Twilio number and our chatbot will collect customers' contact information to alert our representatives to assist the customers.

How we built it
We built our project with machine learning to build the chat bot. We built our site using Javascript, HTMl, and CSS. We also used 3D models for the NFT houses.
